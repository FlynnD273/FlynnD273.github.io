          </a>

          <p>
            This project was made primarily so that I would have an easy-to-access offline todo list of all of my class assignments. I had to learn how to use the Canvas API, and I had to learn how to parse the resultant JSON files into something useful. Once I've received all of the data from Canvas that I need, I then use Linq to filter the collections into the various categories. I need to group the assignments by the class they're from, and sort them by due date if there is a due date. If there's no due date, then those assignments get sent to a different collection. All of these then get written into a markdown file as a checklist, with the due date and Canvas links to the assignments. If an assignment is completed on Canvas or checked off locally, it will remove that assignment from the list. I also implemented a weekly todo list that resets every Monday for more customization. This project is meant to integrate with Obsidian Notes, which is why I chose the markdown format.

          </a>

          <p>
            This project was made so I could easily cut videos to the desired start and endpoints. It's built entirely in WPF, and is essentially a wrapper for ffmpeg, which is the tool that does the actual trimming. There are lots of applications out there that can cut videos like this, but most start up a lot slower, and at least in the case of the built in Windows utility, crash a lot more. I just wanted something that makes it quick and easy to cut either individual videos or entire folders of video files.

          </a>

          <p>
            This project was mostly made so I could practice using Python more. At WPI, I can download my class schedule as an Excel spreadsheet. This Python script will read that Excel spreadsheet and generate an iCalendar file that I can import into my calendar. This involves parsing times from text, and using pandas to read the Excel spreadsheet into a dataframe. I also had to learn about the iCalendar format and how the different properties work together.

            <h3 class="project-title">Parse Pearson Expressions</h3>
          </a>

          <p>
            This project was an exercise of implementing context-free grammars. I had learned this in freshman year at WPI, and I thought that this would be a good way to practice actually using it. Pearson for physics uses a proprietary format for its expression editor, and it's annoying to type out the expression again if I need to use a calculator. So I made this program to convert from Pearson's format to a format that any search engine will understand. I also added functionality to just do the calculation locally too to speed up my work.
