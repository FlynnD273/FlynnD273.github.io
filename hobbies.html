        <h2>Quadcopters</h2>

        <p>
          A few years ago, I fell in love with first person view (FPV) quadcopters. These drones can be incredibly
          agile, and are super fun to fly. I've learned how to build and repair my own drones, as well as design 3D
          printed parts for it.

            we have spotters on the lookout for anyone who might be walking by so the pilots can be warned</figcaption>

        <p>
          I have also helped numerous people on a Discord server with troubleshooting their FPV drones. At WPI, I have
          also helped teach workshops about FPV drones.

        <h2>Art</h2>

        <p>
          I have always had an interest in 2D and 3D animation, visual effects, drawing, and photography. The majority
          of the software I use is free and open source.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have extensive experience in using Blender, DaVinci Resolve, Embergen, Nuke, Natron, GIMP, Krita, and
          Procreate. I also have experience using Adobe Photoshop, After Effects, Animate, and Lightroom. You can find
          more of my projects on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/flynnd03/">Instagram page</a>.
