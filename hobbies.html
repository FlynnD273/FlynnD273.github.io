          <h2>Quadcopters</h2>

          <p>
            A few years ago, I found out about first person view (FPV) quadcopters. These drones can be incredibly agile, and are super fun to fly. During the build process, I learned about the different components of the drone, including how to interpret specifications for motors, cameras, and radio units. I also obtained an amateur radio license, learned how to solder, read wiring diagrams, and troubleshoot electronics. Once I got the drone working, I then moved on to design and 3D print custom parts in order to use the space in the drone more efficiently. Because I have to design for crashes, I learned how to make the parts survive high-speed impacts.

          <p>
            Since I learned so much during the process of building the drone, I decided to join a Discord server for FPV drones and help people on there. I joined at basically the peak growth of the server, so there were always plenty of people asking questions about what the best components were for their drones, how to wire the components, and troubleshoot issues. Since I had come across many of the issues before while building my own drone, I was able to solve the vast majority of peoples' issues. 
          </p>

          <p>
            When I arrived at WPI, I quickly became involved in the FPV drone club there. In that club, I helped teach a few workshops. One was teaching people how to assemble and wire a drone, and the other one was teaching people how to actually fly the drones using simulators. Both were really fun, and everyone had a great time learning.

            I have always had an interest in 2D and 3D animation, visual effects, drawing, and photography. I make these projects on my own time, and the majority of the software I use is free, or at the very least, open source. I have extensive experience in using Blender, DaVinci Resolve, Embergen, Nuke, Natron, GIMP, Krita, and Procreate. I also have experience using Adobe Photoshop, After Effects, Animate, and Lightroom. You can find more of my projects on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/flynnd03/">Instagram page</a>.
